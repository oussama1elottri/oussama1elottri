### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, welcome to my profile.
my vision :
Decentralization empowers humanity's achievements by authorizing what's written and should being, not what's 0.1% wanting and dedicating. 
That's to apply in Algeria (Ø¨Ø§Ø°Ù† Ø§Ù„Ù„Ù‡) and enhancing Blockchainâ€™s smart contracts through AI enhancements will be the trigger.

Skills: Python /  Solidity / Keras / Numpy / pandas / TensorFlow / Docker
